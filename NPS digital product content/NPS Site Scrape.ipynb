    "#### Objective: scrape all websites for NPS to see if they meet the 10 essential travelers information for transportation\n",
    "#### These 10 are:\n",
    "<li>driving directions</li>\n",
    "<li>Public transportation information</li>\n",
    "<li>Bike and pedestrian information</li>\n",
    "<li>Parking lot locations and accommodations</li>\n",
    "<li>Parking lot peak use and availability</li>\n",
    "<li>congestion information</li>\n",
    "<li>travel distances and travel time to sites within the park</li>\n",
    "<li>Accessibility</li>\n",
    "<li>Description of transportation experience</li>\n",
    "<li>Alternative fueling stations</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "#### Together, these 10 measures can allow NPS to understand how their parks are providing transportation to visitors. This information can be used to evaluate each park and plan for an improved park experience in the future. "
